### [Instruction effects on randomness in sequence generation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1113654/full)
Guseva, M., Bogler, C., Allefeld, C., & Haynes, J. D. (2023) in Frontiers in Psychology, 14, 1113654.

Randomness is a fundamental property of human behavior. It occurs both in the form of intrinsic random variability, 
say when repetitions of a task yield slightly different behavioral outcomes, or in the form of explicit randomness, say 
when a person tries to avoid being predicted in a game of rock, paper and scissors. Randomness has frequently been studied 
using random sequence generation tasks (RSG). A key finding has been that humans are poor at deliberately producing random behavior. 
At the same time, it has been shown that people might be better randomizers if randomness is only an implicit (rather than an explicit) 
requirement of the task. We therefore hypothesized that randomization performance might vary with the exact instructions with which 
randomness is elicited. To test this, we acquired data from a large online sample (n = 388), where every participant made 1,000 binary 
choices based on one of the following instructions: choose either randomly, freely, irregularly, according to an imaginary coin toss or 
perform a perceptual guessing task. Our results show significant differences in randomness between the conditions as quantified by 
conditional entropy and estimated Markov order. The randomization scores were highest in the conditions where people were asked to be 
irregular or mentally simulate a random event (coin toss) thus yielding recommendations for future studies on randomization behavior.

## [Surgical face masks do not impair the decoding of facial expressions of negative affect more severely in older than in younger adults](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00403-8)

Henke, L., Guseva, M., Wagemans, K., Pischedda, D., Haynes, J. D., Jahn, G., & Anders, S. (2022) in Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 7(1), 1-15.

Surgical face masks reduce the spread of airborne pathogens but also disturb the flow of information between individuals. The risk of 
getting seriously ill after infection with SARS-COV-2 during the present COVID-19 pandemic amplifies with age, suggesting that face masks
should be worn especially during face-to-face contact with and between older people. However, the ability to accurately perceive and 
understand communication signals decreases with age, and it is currently unknown whether face masks impair facial communication more 
severely in older people. We compared the impact of surgical face masks on dynamic facial emotion recognition in younger (18–30 years) 
and older (65–85 years) adults (N = 96) in an online study. Participants watched short video clips of young women who facially expressed
anger, fear, contempt or sadness. Faces of half of the women were covered by a digitally added surgical face mask. As expected, emotion 
recognition accuracy declined with age, and face masks reduced emotion recognition accuracy in both younger and older participants.
Unexpectedly, the effect of face masks did not differ between age groups. Further analyses showed that masks also reduced the participants’ 
overall confidence in their emotion judgements, but not their performance awareness (the difference between their confidence ratings for 
correct and incorrect responses). Again, there were no mask-by-age interactions. Finally, data obtained with a newly developed questionnaire
(attitudes towards face masks, atom) suggest that younger and older people do not differ in how much they feel impaired in their
understanding of other people’s emotions by face masks or how useful they find face masks in confining the COVID-19 pandemic. In sum, 
these findings do not provide evidence that the impact of face masks on the decoding of facial signals is disproportionally larger in 
older people.

## [Willingness-to-pay for Green Electricity: The Increasing Gap Between Fiction and Reality](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12398-016-0185-4)

Andor, M., Frondel, M., Guseva, M. et al. in Zeitschrift für Energiewirtschaft 40, 199–209 (2016).

This paper presents evidence on preferences for green electricity, drawing on two stated-preference surveys conducted in 2013
and 2015 among 6000 households. It uncovers a strong contrast between the households – rising general acceptance of supporting 
renewable energy technologies and their shrinking individual willingness-to-pay for green electricity.
