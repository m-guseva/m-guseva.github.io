🧠 I am a cognitive neuroscientist from Berlin and currently in the final phase of my doctoral studies where I am using complex neuroimaging data to understand how the brain controls behavior. 

💬 I find great joy in extracting relevant insights from large datasets and communicating them to the target audience. 

💪🏻 As an autodidact by nature I am never afraid to teach myself challenging new methods. 

👩🏻‍💻 My goal is to focus my analytical skills in the field of data science. I love working with Python, SQL, Matlab - Check out my personal and doctoral programming projects here.

🖌 If I'm not working on some Python project, I'm spending my time creating art, check my work here.
