I am a cognitive neuroscientist, currently in the final phase of my doctoral studies where I am using complex neuroimaging data to understand how the brain controls behavior. 
Since my master studies in Maastricht University I have found great joy in extracting relevant insights from large datasets and communicating them to the target audience. I am a strong autodidact and am never afraid to teach myself challenging new methods. My goal is to focus my analytical skills in the field of data science. 
I love working with Python, SQL, Matlab - Check out my personal and doctoral programming projects here.
