üéì Education
======
* Ph.D. in Charit√© Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin, 2019-now 
* M.Sc. in Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience, Maastricht University (2016-2018)
* B.Sc. in Management and Economics, Ruhr University Bochum (2011-2015)

üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨ Work experience
======
* Doctoral Researcher (Jul 2019 - now)
  * [Charit√© Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin](https://www.charite.de/) (Germany)
  * Main topic of research: The psychology and neuroscience of human randomization
  * Conducted research projects including:
    * Designed, scripted and executed a neuroimaging study (functional magnetic resonance imaging) using Python, successfully collected brain data from 90 people. Analyzed data using both classic univariate and multivariate (linear support vector machine algorithm) methods in MATLAB, manuscript in submission process
    * Executed an online psychology experiment by planning and scripting with JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Collected experimental data from 543 people and conducted detailed analysis of the behavioral data resulting in  a published [manuscript](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1113654/full).
    * Scripted another online psychology experiment and collected data from 96 participants leading to a published [manuscript](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00403-8).
  * Supervised two master students


* Research intern (Nov 2017 - Jul 2018)
  * [Center for Cognitive Neuroscience Berlin](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/einrichtungen/ccnb/index.html) (Germany)
  * Worked on a project on memory-guided reinforcement learning with diffusion weighted neuroimaging
    * Conducted the experiment with 32 participants, analyzed the data with FSL, a command line interface tool to analyze diffusion weighted images
 
* Research assistant (May 2015 - Jul 2018)
  * [Leibniz Institute for Economic Research](https://www.rwi-essen.de/) Essen (Germany) (formerly known as RWI Essen)
  * Involved in several behavioral economics projects, learned using STATA for statistical analysis, project on green electricity and willingness-to-pay resulted in a [publication]((https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12398-016-0185-4)).
